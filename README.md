# Gemini GitHub Actions

A repository of GitHub Actions powered by Gemini AI for intelligent repository automation.

## Overview

This repository contains GitHub Actions workflows that leverage Google's Gemini AI to automate common repository tasks with intelligent decision-making capabilities. These workflows demonstrate how AI can enhance your development workflow by automating code reviews, enforcing contribution guidelines, triaging issues, and more.

## Available Workflows

### üìê PR Contribution Guidelines Enforcement

Automatically validates pull requests against your repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file using Gemini AI. Posts intelligent feedback as PR comments with actionable checklists for contributors.

**Features:**

- Reads and evaluates PR content against contribution guidelines
- Posts upserted comments (no duplicates) with PASS/FAIL status
- Optional workflow enforcement on violations (Set repository variable FAIL_ON_GUIDELINE_VIOLATIONS=false to disable enforcement)
- Handles complex PR content safely (quotes, newlines, etc.)
